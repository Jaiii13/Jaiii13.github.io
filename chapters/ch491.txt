I've been through so much lately. It's been rough, honestly.
My time in Ende was short, and with all the work piling up recently, it's been exhausting. Ende must be huge. Just wandering around and reading minds takes up the whole day, man.
Reading minds, sorting situations, moving around, then reading minds again. It felt like the grueling task of finding and organizing chronicles one by one in a haphazardly arranged library.
But hey, there's a certain thrill in that kind of organizing work. Picking out the Orcs precisely from among tens of thousands, then singling them out to destroy—it was secretly fun. Seeing them, who'd been hiding among the citizens enjoying sweet fruits, gradually grow uneasy... well, I felt a sense of satisfaction in my own way.
Today, I finished my work quickly, shook off the tail, and returned to the mansion. As I passed through the dim courtyard to enter the mansion, two human shadows flickered. The Returner and Aji were waiting for me in front of the mansion.
What? You two stayed awake waiting for me? Pointless... But somehow, it warms my heart a little. Who knew having someone waiting for you could feel so heartwarming.
“Where've you been wandering off to?”
Cancel that. The warmth in my chest started to fill with smoke again, turning into a lump. Hearing the Returner's blunt reply, I answered indifferently.
“Why? I just did the work you wanted me to do.”
“You could at least tell me where you were, what you were doing, or when you'd be back. So I wouldn't worry for no reason.”
“Well, did you explain anything before you left? You just said you'd be back late tonight and then vanished.”
“I did come back late tonight!”
“I didn't even get a chance to say when I'd be back. Couldn't you have just listened?”
As if at a loss for words, the Returner's expression grew even more sullen.
‘I'm strong and roughly know what to watch out for in this time period, but you've lost your power, even as the King of Humans. What if you get hurt or even die, going out alone without any sense?’
Thoughts are kinder than words, huh? You should just think instead of speaking. Or else, just spill everything honestly. Then maybe half of it would go away.
“Stop standing there like a statue outside the door and come in first.”
‘I don't know what you're doing, but you seem really busy, so I should rest.’
You should swap your thoughts and words. You have a knack for turning even kind thoughts into something annoying.
When I came back, I saw the Manjeonseok sitting alone on the dining table. Usually, the Returner would put that in the sub-space, but it seemed they were waiting for me and hadn't put it away yet.
The Returner placed their hand on the Manjeonseok and asked.
“Did you eat?”
“I just grabbed something while working.”
“Want to eat?”
“I'll skip it tonight since it's almost bedtime.”
“Speak up sooner. I already pressed it.”
Actions speak louder than words. Feeling a bit peckish, I decided to gratefully eat. A thick, simmered red soup arrived, and I wolfed it down, feeling my body warm up.
The Returner waited until I finished eating, then spoke the moment I set down my spoon.

“You. Are you a magician?”
“Whoa. How did you know that?”
“What's so surprising? You used to go around saying you were a magician whenever you did anything.”
“How do you remember that? I thought you'd forgotten already.”
“Why? You're not famous, but I remember that much.”
“I'm more suspicious of your memory than my own fame.”
“Hey!”
After exchanging friendly jabs, the Returner leaned back in their chair, arms crossed.
“You hear the name ‘magician’ around. They say you're causing quite a stir in Ende? Impossible not to notice.”
“I'm not exactly causing a stir. Just having a bit of fun teasing people.”
“Exactly. From what I hear, public sentiment isn't that bad toward you?”
Oh. It's already reached the Returner's ears? This is a bit surprising.
“What's the public sentiment like?”
“Ordinary folks treat you like a jolly prankster. And the Ende Security Force and Obelisks are secretly welcoming you. They say the Magician only targets and destroys those who disrupt the peace.”
That's rewarding. I nodded proudly. Seeing my reaction, the Returner spoke.
“So. What exactly are you doing out there under the name of Magician? Are you part of the Security Corps?”
“It's a bit different from the Security Corps. They can't take any action until an incident actually happens. And even when it does, it's hard to tell who's the villain and who's just caught up in it.”
“You know?”
“Of course. Eavesdropping, hiding, deceiving, acting. Lurking among humans to stir up their desires. As the King of Humans, I'm quite skilled at that sort of thing.”
I left out the mind-reading part while explaining, but the Returner, who'd experienced all manner of bizarre abilities by now, accepted my achievements without much doubt.
“Before fighting the Wolf King, we must first restore order to Ende. Only by concentrating all of Ende's strength can we stand against the Wolf King.”
“What? You're actually good at this when you get down to it? Why didn't you do it sooner!”
"This kind of remedy is like a stimulant—it loses its effect if used too long. Chaos stems from inequality. If you don't address the root cause, it'll erupt eventually. Plus, once they get used to it, they'll find other ways."
Right now, this is foreign territory, and I'm running wild, revealing my every move, so they can't keep up. But if they ever discover my true identity by chance, I'll instantly transform from a symbol of fear into a target to be eliminated. If an enemy appears, Orcma will only harden further and confront me.
‘You’re quite something. You’re no help in actual combat, but you’re surprisingly useful in all those other trivial matters.’
Say it out loud. Don’t just think it and brush it off. I’m letting it slide because I can read minds. Anyone else would’ve ditched you and run long ago.
“Got it. Is there anything else you need?“
”Nothing really. Ah, just like worms squirm when stepped on, Ende's troublemakers will probably kick up a fuss. If we just get through that, there won't be any lingering trouble.“
”If they're troublemakers, should we deal with them beforehand?“
”It's better if Ende handles it themselves. Internal discipline is the fastest way to forge stronger bonds."
‘Hmph. Well, every time Ende failed to stop the Wolf King before, it was when Ende’s power was weakened. Hughes, that guy. He’s the type who’s really easy to deal with when he’s an ally. Gets along with everyone. Knows human nature well. If I had to say, he seems like he’d be good at internal affairs…. I'd like to plant him somewhere as a base of operations.'
Haha. What's that supposed to mean? You're no different. Not that you're easy to deal with as an ally, but you'd be terrifying as an enemy. If we become enemies, you'll die in the next round without even knowing why.
“Since I've done my part, shall we examine what you've done, Mr. Shay? What exactly have you been up to?”
“I went to the Beast Clan and delivered Ende's message. Since the Wolf King is invading, we should join forces for the peace of the Plains.”
“Is that force even necessary?”
“They're savages. If we don't reach out first, they might side with the Werewolves and invade Ende.”
Ah, right. You said the werewolves allied with the Wolf King. Though the Wolf King is hostile to all humans, he doesn't attack werewolves. We could form an indirect alliance with humans through them.
It all fits together like a well-oiled machine. The Returner had his own plans, it seems.
“The Orc Berserker, Gruul. Even he, a pig-like beastman who understands reason, will lend his strength to Ende. We should be safe.”
Oh ho. An Orc Berserker. A beastman who understands reason and is powerful...
...Orc? Pig-like beastman?
A slightly ominous thought flashed through my mind, but still, he's not a citizen of Ende, so it should be fine, right?
No group exists without force. If there is one, I hope it doesn't come out to refute this statement but hides quickly. Another armed group will come and swallow it whole.
The ‘Tusk’, the power of Orcma, was a mercenary group composed of pig-like humanoids, and at the same time, it was the largest organization cooperating with Orcma.
The first Tusk, Urkpeng, said to his subordinates.
“Two liaison officers connecting to the ranchers outside Ende have vanished. Rumor has it they were found naked, impaled on Ende's outer wall, struggling. Fifteen carts were turned into toy cards, and the pack horses, carrying drunken horse-kin on their backs, went out on parade before being reclaimed by Ende's security force.”
Individually, these are minor damages. But all these damages accumulate, eroding our cohesion.
“Above all, the magician... he's targeting only ‘Orcma’.”
The biggest reason Orcma could grow in power was their anonymity.
It's no surprise that orcs cause trouble. But Orcma hid among those orcs.
Some operate without even knowing they're Orcsma. Some know, but don't understand the full extent of their activities. Some hold quite pivotal roles, yet commit no crimes themselves.
Too minor to warrant concern, impossible to tell friend from foe. Hidden behind anonymity, Orcsma grew stronger day by day.
"The Magician. He must not be left alone. For the glory of the orcs, no... at least to receive treatment equal to that of other beastmen. We must secure more privileges. The days when orcs were persecuted. We cannot return to a time when beheading an orc on the street carried no punishment... "
In those days, Orcma could never have been formed. If you caused trouble, your head would be chopped off immediately, followed by torture. Not just yours, but your family's.
But not anymore. Ende is a city of beastmen, and the treatment of pig beastmen has improved. Since the appearance of the Furry Saint, it's impossible to kill beastmen indiscriminately like before. In this situation, distinguishing Orcsma precisely is as difficult as excising only the diseased part from the body. Cut the wrong part, and the body suffers.
Yet the magician manages it. Whether he truly wields magic or not, his mere presence caused orcs fearful of being cut out to turn away from Orkma. If this continues, forget orc revival—even their unity will crumble.
Urkpeng, his resolve renewed, looked at his subordinate and asked.
“You spread the false information, right?”
“Yes. We told our collaborators to gather here to establish a code for dealing with the magician. If the magician is obtaining information through some method, he'll want to disrupt this meeting.”
“Right. If the magician comes here unwittingly, Mother will bite his neck.”
“But we don't know who the magician is. Can we find him?”
“There aren't that many humans in Ende. Any human who comes here can be considered the magician. Report immediately if you find him.”
Eomni waited, hidden in various spots, for the human who would innocently come here. Similarly deceived collaborators also arrived, but they were sent back through a secret passage prepared in advance.
‘When will you come, magician? If your goal is Ockma, you won’t miss this chance.’
Like Eomni hidden in the jaws, they watched their prey silently, yet sharply.
Then, suddenly. Among several passersby, a hooded figure slowly approached. No bulging marks were visible beneath the tightly pulled hood.
“A human!”
Immediately, tusks burst from the jaws. From rooftops, behind walls, from beneath the ground, tusks surged up, surrounding the human. The hooded figure, caught off guard by the sudden surge of shadows, looked around in panic.
“Found you. Magician.”
Urkpeng approached him, clanging his gauntlets menacingly and growling.
“How long did you think you could hide your true identity?”
“I don't know who you are, but this is as far as you go.”
“You've finally shown your tail.”
There was no one else who would come hooded but the magician. A simple deduction, but one with reason. The orcs, confident in the trap they'd set, surrounded the human.
But they should have thought a little harder.
The magician who had hidden his identity and ravaged Ende all this time wouldn't approach so conspicuously.
“I have no tail.”
The human declared boldly, then forcefully threw off his hood. The mother, who had been about to confirm the magician's face, gasped when she saw the identity revealed beneath the hood.
“However. I do have feet to step on tails. It seems... you're the ones who revealed your tails.”
Sapien. Ende's official, and the captain of the Obelisk.
Seeing Ende's strongest guardian, Eomni and the others looked at each other in panic. Though Eomni was a famous mercenary group, they weren't heavily armed within the city... and their opponent was Obelisk's strongest official. Messing with him was trouble, and they couldn't even touch him in the first place.
“The, the magician...”
“An anonymous letter arrived at Obelisk. It said a group of troublemakers would gather at this time, in this place.”
The moment the hood hit the ground.
CRASH. Sapien slammed into the ground like a thunderbolt, grabbed an orc by the throat, and slammed him into the earth. The orc lost consciousness and his mother in that single, beast-like strike.
The warriors of Ende fight beasts. Thus, they gradually become like beasts themselves. They survive by mimicking the movements of beasts that have endured the wild.
Having incapacitated one with explosive ki, Sapien snatched the gauntlet and slipped it on. It was larger than his fist, but it didn't matter. Primitive ki filled the gauntlet completely.
“So the letter sender is a magician? I should thank him. He gave me the chance to clean up the trash all at once.”
“Yik...!”
Cornered, Eomni made a drastic decision. Urk Pang shouted.
“Scatter!”
Victory in battle was uncertain. An even bigger problem was that the opponent was a public official.
One promise the Suin made to the vassal state to be recognized as a city of Suin: guaranteeing the safety of the public figure. If the Suin harmed or attempted to harm the public figure, Ende could take necessary measures.
The biggest thing was that the home country, the Lilac Vassal State, could intervene.
The pig Suin created Orkma to revive themselves. If they faced outside interference before establishing their foothold, everything they'd done so far would be for naught. Praying as few Orcs as possible were captured, he ordered the retreat.
But there was one more thing they overlooked.
“If you thought you could escape... I'm afraid you're mistaken.”
Amidst the humans fleeing en masse, sensing the wolf's threat, the public figure chose to remain alone in Ende. The city's guardian, Obelisk, was no match for a mere mercenary band.
Thud. Thud. Thud. With each swing of his human hand, another fell. Marks of orcs were stamped into the walls and floor. He charged like a beast, kicking off the floor and walls.
Toward that Sapien, Urk Pang charged, gauntlet raised.
Thud. The collision of orc and human produced a thunderous roar. A finger-shaped piece of metal flew out from the broken gauntlet. It belonged to Urk Pang, whose qi cultivation was relatively weaker.
Beasts excel in physical prowess but lack wisdom. That's why their qigong is relatively weak, and why they've never become the mainstream of history.
Urk Pang shouted, somehow managing to grab Sapiens with his mangled gauntlet.
“Go! Scatter!”
“Captain…!”
“Hurry!”
“A heartbreaking effort.”
Sapiens flipped his body instantly, flinging Urk Pang to the ground. The orc's back slammed into the ground. Leaving him gasping for breath behind, Sapien moved to deal with the rest.
Then, the orc's powerful hand grabbed Sapien's sleeve. Urkpeng, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, tightened his grip even more.
“You can't go...!”
“Hmm.”
His tearful resistance was futile. Sapien's fists and kicks pounded Urkpeng mercilessly. Only after the orc's massive body flew through the air five times did the strength drain from his grip.
But the time he bought was quite valuable. While time dragged on, the tusks carried their fallen comrade and vanished without a trace.
Sapien flicked the dust from his clothes and muttered, gazing at the street now empty of orcs.
“Should've brought some men with me.”
He was confident he wouldn't be hurt. But he hadn't considered having to catch every fleeing orc. The mage's letter had arrived so suddenly, he'd had no choice.
Still, capturing even one was something. There were many ways to make someone talk. Especially if the target was a pig-like humanoid.
“Come to think of it... the magician. Who exactly is he?”
What was the identity of the one who had stirred up trouble in the city? Curiosity arose, but Sapien didn't dwell on it much.
If it benefited the city, he intended to gladly make use of it.
