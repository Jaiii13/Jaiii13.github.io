I’ve been through a lot lately. Honestly, it’s been rough.

My stay in Ende was short, but the work piled up nonstop. Ende must be enormous—just walking around and reading minds takes up the entire day.

Reading minds, sorting through situations, moving on, then reading minds again. It felt like digging through a messy library, trying to piece together scattered chronicles one by one.

Still, there was a thrill to it. Picking out orcs hiding among tens of thousands, dragging them into the open, and destroying them—there was a certain satisfaction. Watching those who had blended in so comfortably among citizens start to squirm uneasily… that felt like an accomplishment.

Today, I finished my work quickly, shook off the tail following me, and returned to the mansion. As I crossed the dim courtyard, I saw two shadows waiting in front of the door.

The Regressor. And Azzy.

What? You two waited for me all this time? Pointless… but somehow, my chest felt warm. Who knew having someone waiting for you could feel so nice?

“Where’ve you been wandering off to?”

…Forget it. That warmth turned to smoke, then into a lump in my chest. Hearing her sullen tone, I answered flatly.

“What? I did the work Mr. Shei wanted done.”

“You could at least tell me where you were, what you were doing, when you’d be back. So I wouldn’t worry for nothing.”

“Well, did you explain anything before you left? You just said you’d be back late tonight and disappeared.”

“I did come back late tonight!”

“I didn’t even get a chance to say when I’d be back. Couldn’t you have just listened?”

Her face grew even more sour.

『I’m strong enough to handle myself, and I know what to watch out for in this time period. But you—King of Humans—you’ve lost your powers. What if you got hurt, or even killed, going out alone without knowing what you’re facing?』

Hah. Your thoughts are kinder than your words. You should just keep it in your head. Or better yet, say them straight. Maybe then half the irritation would disappear.

“Stop standing there like a statue and come inside already.”

『I don’t know what you’re up to, but you seem busy. You should rest.』

See? Switch your thoughts and your words. You’d sound a lot less annoying.

Inside, I noticed the Manjeonseok lying on the table. Normally the Regressor stashes it in her subspace. She must’ve left it out on purpose, maybe waiting for me.

She placed her hand on it and asked, “Did you eat?”

“I grabbed something while working.”

“Want to eat?”

“I’ll skip. It’s already late.”

“Speak up sooner. I already pressed it.”

Actions louder than words. The meal appeared anyway, so I ate. A thick, simmering red stew, rich and hot. My body warmed with each bite.

Only after I’d finished did she speak.

“You. You’re a magician, aren’t you?”

“Huh? How did you figure that out?”

“What’s with the surprise? You used to go around bragging you were a magician whenever you did anything.”

“How do you even remember that? I thought you’d forgotten.”

“Why? You’re not famous, but I can remember at least that much.”

“I’m more suspicious of Mr. Shei’s memory than my own reputation.”

“Hey!”

We traded a bit of banter, then she leaned back in her chair, arms crossed.

“I keep hearing the name ‘Magician’ in Ende. You’ve been causing quite a stir, haven’t you?”

“I wouldn’t say stir. Just a little fun teasing people.”

“Exactly. From what I hear, the public sentiment isn’t bad. Ordinary folks think you’re a troublemaker, but a delightful one. And the Ende Security Force and the Obelisks? They’re secretly happy. They say the Magician only takes out those disrupting the peace.”

Not bad. I nodded with pride. Seeing me, she continued.

“So. What are you really doing out there under that name? Are you working with the Security Corps?”

“Not exactly. The Corps can’t act until something already happens. Even then, it’s hard to separate villains from bystanders.”

“You knew all that?”

“Of course. Eavesdropping, hiding, deceiving, acting… slipping among people and stirring their desires. That’s my specialty as the King of Humans.”

I didn’t mention the mind-reading, but she accepted it without doubt. She’s seen too many strange abilities already.

“Before we face the Wolf King, Ende needs order. Only with everyone united can we stand against him.”

“What the—? You’re actually good at this when you put in the effort? Why didn’t you do it sooner?”

“This kind of remedy’s like a stimulant. Use it too long, and the effect wears off. Chaos comes from inequality. If you don’t fix the root, it’ll erupt again. And once they adapt, they’ll find new ways.”

Right now, I’m a foreigner running wild, moving openly, throwing them off balance. But if they ever discover my true identity, I’ll instantly flip from symbol of fear to target. And if an enemy rises, Orcma will only stiffen in resolve.

『You’re something else. Useless in direct combat, but surprisingly good at all these side jobs.』

Say it aloud, damn it. Don’t just think it. Anyone else would’ve ditched you long ago.

“Got it. Anything else?”

“Nothing major. Ende’s troublemakers will probably kick up a fuss, but once that’s dealt with, there won’t be lasting problems.”

“If they’re troublemakers, should we get rid of them first?”

“No. Better if Ende handles it themselves. Internal discipline forges stronger bonds.”

『True. The only times Ende lost to the Wolf King were when its power fractured. Hughes—that guy’s easy to work with. Gets along with anyone. Knows people. He’d be good for internal affairs.』

Ha. You’re no different. Not easy as an ally, but terrifying as an enemy. If we ever become enemies, I’ll die in the next round without even knowing why.

“Since I've done my part, shall we examine what you've done, Mr. Shei? What exactly have you been up to?”

“I went to the Beast Clan and delivered Ende’s message. The Wolf King is invading, so I asked them to unite for peace.”

“Was that necessary?”

“They’re savages. If we don’t reach out, they might side with the Wolf-kin and invade Ende.”

Ah. Right. The Wolf-kin allied with the Wolf King. He doesn’t attack them, so they can serve as intermediaries. It makes sense.

“The Orc Berserker, Gruul. Even he—a pig-beastkin with reason—will lend his strength. Ende should be safe.”

Oh? An Orc Berserker. Powerful and rational…

…Wait. Orc? Pig-beastkin?

A bad thought flashed, but he wasn’t an Ende citizen. Should be fine.

No group survives without force. If one tries, another stronger group swallows it.

The **Tusk**, Orcma’s power, was a mercenary band of pig-beastkin, the largest group tied to Orcma.

Their leader, Urkpeng, growled to his men.

“Two of my contacts outside Ende vanished. Rumor is they were found naked, impaled on the city walls. Fifteen carts destroyed. The horses paraded around by drunken horse-kin before security seized them.”

Minor incidents alone. But together, they eat away at cohesion.

“Worst of all—the Magician. He’s targeting only Orcma.”

Orcma’s strength came from anonymity. They hid among ordinary orcs, impossible to tell apart. Some members didn’t even realize they were part of Orcma. Others knew, but played small roles.

Hidden in that gray space, Orcma grew stronger every day.

“The Magician. We can’t let him live. For the orcs’ glory—for equality with other beastkin—we must grow stronger. The days of persecution must never return.”

In the past, they would’ve been slaughtered in the streets. Families tortured. But times changed. With Ende now a beastkin city and the Saintess protecting them, indiscriminate killings weren’t possible.

Cutting out Orcma was like trying to excise only diseased flesh from a body. One wrong cut and the whole body suffers.

Yet the Magician managed it. Whether he truly wielded magic or not, his presence alone caused fear. Orcs began drifting away from Orcma. If this continued, not just revival—even unity—would collapse.

Urkpeng clenched his jaw.

“You spread the rumors?”

“Yes. Our collaborators gathered here, to set codes against the Magician. If he’s gathering information, he’ll come to disrupt this meeting.”

“Good. If the Magician comes blindly, Mother will have his head.”

“But we don’t even know who he is. Can we find him?”

“There aren’t many humans in Ende. Any human who shows up here could be him. Report immediately.”

Eomni lay in wait, jaws open. Collaborators arrived and were quietly sent back.

『When will you come, Magician? If Orcma is your target, you won’t miss this chance.』

Then, from among passersby, a hooded figure appeared. No bulky weapons, just a tight hood.

“A human!”

Tusks burst forth from rooftops, alleys, the ground itself. The hooded figure flinched.

“Found you. Magician.”

Urkpeng stepped forward, gauntlets clanging.

“How long did you think you could hide?”

“I don’t know who you are, but this is as far as you go.”

“You’ve finally shown your tail.”

But they should have thought harder.

“I have no tail.”

The man ripped off his hood. The orcs froze.

“But I do have feet. And they’re good for stomping on tails. Seems to me, you’re the ones who just revealed yours.”

Sapien. Captain of the Obelisk. Ende’s strongest guardian.

The jaws of Orcma snapped shut in panic. They weren’t prepared for a city fight. Not against him.

“The… the Magician…”

“An anonymous letter arrived at Obelisk. It said a band of troublemakers would gather here at this time, in this place.”

The hood hit the ground.

CRASH. Sapien smashed down like a thunderbolt, seizing an orc and slamming him into the earth. The orc collapsed, tusks shattering.

Ende’s warriors fight beasts. To survive, they become beasts themselves.

Sapien snatched a gauntlet, qi flaring to fill it completely.

“The one who sent the letter—Magician. I should thank him. He gave me the chance to clean up trash in one sweep.”

“Yeeek…!”

“Scatter!” Urkpeng roared.

Victory wasn’t certain. Worse—the enemy was a public official. Harming one would let the Lilac Vassal State intervene. Orcma would be crushed before it ever established its foothold.

“Go! Scatter!”

But Sapien was faster. Thud. Thud. With each strike, another orc fell.

Urkpeng charged, gauntlet raised.

The collision thundered. His qi too weak, his gauntlet shattered. Blood dripping, he grabbed Sapien’s robe and snarled.

“You… can’t… go!”

“Hmm.”

Futile. Sapien pummeled him, fists and kicks pounding until Urkpeng’s massive body flew. Only then did his grip loosen.

But it was enough. His men carried their fallen and vanished.

Sapien brushed off the dust, surveying the empty street.

“Should’ve brought a squad.”

He never doubted his safety. But catching every orc was impossible.

Still—capturing even one was something.

“Come to think of it… the Magician. Who is he, really?”

The question lingered. But Sapien shrugged it off.

If it benefited the city, he intended to gladly make use of it.
