Gluta, the head chef of Kitchen Gluta and a renowned businessman even in Ende. With diligence and trust as his motto, he is as strict with others as he is with himself. It’s fortunate he doesn’t treat customers harshly. Had he not chosen a profession serving guests, he would have become a grumpy old man complaining everywhere.

Even he couldn’t treat the elderly pig Suin, who was considerably older than him, with disrespect.

“Mrs. Mig. Would you please restrain yourself?”

“Restrain? Is that something you eat?”

“No, that’s not it.”

“Then go eat some candy! I’ve lived like this for 80 years. I’ll keep living like this until I kick the bucket!”

Even when he was young, she was already middle-aged. Gluta had also been treated by her a couple of times. Strictness is hard to apply to an elderly woman over 80.

Old Pigie swung the ladle wildly above her head and shouted.

“My only crime is feeding children who have no home and go hungry! If that’s a crime, why don’t you ask your mother about her crimes first? Like you’re doing to me!“

”But this goes beyond simply feeding them, doesn’t it?”

Gluta looked around Mrs. Mig’s dining table. A single household table with railings attached provided several seats. About ten seats. It was too shabby to be called a shop, but it was excessively many for an old woman living alone.

“They say they serve the soul food of the Orcs, but Mrs. Mig’s house is clearly a restaurant. “Don’t the orcs actually come eat and then pay money in return?”

“They eat for free and give a little food or pocket change!”

“With other restaurants selling meat targeted by those orc bastards and struggling, the only places doing any business now are tables like yours, serving pig orcs. Not that it’s intentional… but it doesn’t look good.”

“Like I’m making a penny off this! I’m barely scraping by day to day—what’s left to spare?”

“Lately, hordes of pig-men have been coming in to eat and leave.”

Clang. Mrs. Mig threw the ladle to the floor. The thick stew that remained spilled in a long trail across the carpet. Mrs. Migg pointed an accusing finger at Gluta, her voice trembling with fury.

“So what? Can’t I run a business? Where’s a place that’ll hire an old woman past eighty?”

“…Well.”

“I’m no good for meat either. I’m too old—all I can chew is bone! And even that’s no good, with all the marrow sucked out. It’s a blessing to die somewhere out of sight! Fine, since I’m going to die anyway, just kill me now! Make feed out of my bones!”

Gluta, who knew the situation all too well, couldn’t say anything more.

The chaos stirred up by the pig-kin is bypassing the pig-kin. Unlike other shapeshifters’ communities shaking, the pig shapeshifters’ community is becoming even more solid. Gluta found this suspicious, which is why he came to Mrs. Mig’s table.

In other words, he was just suspicious.

He already knew Mrs. Mig ran a restaurant. He also knew that if Mrs. Mig stopped running the restaurant, she’d have nothing left to do but die. Gluta wasn’t heartless enough to tell Mrs. Mig to die.

But… that didn’t mean Gluta could die either.

“Then, try to control your customers a bit. I can’t endure this any longer.”

Mrs. Mig glared fiercely at Gluta before speaking.

“If I knew how to control them properly, my child wouldn’t have died like that.”

Mrs. Mig, who had endured every hardship imaginable, was no pushover. Gluta said no more and left the table. Things would remain tough for a while yet… but he just had to hold on a little longer.

After sending Gluta away, Mrs. Mig spat outside and slammed the door shut.

“Damn it. What do you expect me to do… Ugh. Not being dead is my crime, my crime.”

Gluta’s guess was half right. Mrs. Mig was an ally of the Orcs. But a lukewarm one. She kept telling herself feeding them was just business as usual… yet she couldn’t shake the feeling she was getting involved in something dangerous.

“I should have died gracefully. Ugh, tsk tsk.”

“Oh, come on. No matter how old you are, you don’t want to die, right?”

Mrs. Mig startled at the unfamiliar voice. The table where Gluta had just been talking. A stranger was eating stew where no one should have been. Whether starving or just careless, he shoveled the stew into his mouth, blowing on it and making a fuss.

“Ouch, hot. It’s delicious but hot.“

”What rotten bastard steals someone else’s food?“

She shouted, forcing herself to remain calm, but the human calmly rolled the stew around in his mouth, savoring the taste.

”Huh? This flavor? It’s pork?“

”You’re eating it without permission, and you’re complaining about the meat?”

“How curious. A base supporting Orcs serving pork? Do Orcs forget their principles when filling their bellies, or did they just get tricked by a kind-hearted old lady?”

The ominous feeling became reality.

It was strange for a human to visit this alleyway restaurant in the first place. A picky human concerned about hygiene and such would only have one reason to take an interest in her.

The trouble-makers Mrs. Mig feeds and shelters, the Orcs.

“Ah. Two pots? Pork for the other humanoids, and different meat for the pig humanoids? Oh ho. So that’s how it is. Then… we could monopolize the pork supply cut off from its usual buyers and sell it ourselves?”

“Is it any of your business to blabber on like that? I’ve been eating pork for 80 years! I don’t care about that!”

“You wouldn’t care. How much meat could a Pigi living in this old house have eaten in 80 years? It must be recent.”

The human tossed down his spoon and put his feet up on the table. Feeling pressured by his relaxed movements, Mrs. Migg screamed.

“My only crime is feeding the homeless! If that’s a crime, fine! I should just die!”

“Do you really want to die?”

He lightly flicked his arm, and cards embedded themselves into the wooden table. The trembling edges of the cards were as sharp as blades.

The man smiled at Mrs. Mig, who gasped.

“Don’t worry. It doesn’t matter to me whether you’re an elderly grandmother, a pig-human who’s endured hardship, or how pitiful your past is. It doesn’t matter if you’re brazen enough to deny the obvious truth right in front of you.”

Mrs. Mig is a lukewarm collaborator. Naturally, there are others backing her. Those who supply pork, provide funds, and maintain a network for when the chips are down.

Even he probably isn’t Orkma’s head… But if you trace it back, finger by finger, you’ll eventually get there.

“Because in front of me, you’re just one human being.”

“Stop talking nonsense and get lost! Before I report you…”

“Haha. The ones who’d report you are probably your Oakma kids, or someone who begged you to keep a secret.”

Denial means she wants to protect them. Mrs. Mig hoped for nothing more and clung to that. She stubbornly ignored my words.

But I’d already read her mind.

You can’t hide anything from me. Forgetting things as often as a Regressor is practically the only way to hide anything. Though you’ll probably forget what you’re even trying to hide in the first place.

“How could you…!”

I didn’t answer. I just clapped my hands. The iron cards frictioned, briefly sparking. When Mrs. Mig, who had closed her eyes in fright, opened them again, I had already hidden myself within Ende’s chaos.

Around the same time.

The Piggy Bank. The most secretive place within the pig-kin community.

Those without money and facing persecution inevitably become increasingly closed off. They don’t even trust the money in their own hands. At the bottom, it wouldn’t be surprising if someone stabbed you in the back and stole your money.

Naturally, clans who shared blood gathered together, and they hid their easily lost possessions deep within their own hideouts. They assigned the most trustworthy clan member to guard the vault.

This was the pig-men’s little bank, the Pig Vault.

“Hmph. ‘The Table’ was attacked?”

“The matriarchs are trembling with fear. Just recalling that strange human sends shivers down their spines.”

Now, with society somewhat developed and financial knowledge spreading, the Piggy Bank wasn’t as closed off as before. Not only that, they’d even learned how to make money work for them, generating their own profits.

Only the methods were a bit tainted.

The vault keeper, Sherlock, wrinkled his nose in displeasure.

“One? Just one human?”

“That’s what I’ve heard.”

“Description?”

“Well, I’m not sure about that…”

“An outsider? Perhaps someone new to the mansion?”

Even in vast Ende, rumors of a human who bought the mansion with an enormous sum of cash had already spread far and wide. When something strange happened, one couldn’t help but suspect an outsider who appeared out of nowhere.

But the subordinate shook his head in response.

“No. His appearance differs. More importantly, he was in Obel at that time.”

“Hmm. Didn’t he go out? Even knowing his description, you couldn’t find him?”

A single unfamiliar human was disrupting the community. Where did he get his information? What abilities did he possess? They couldn’t even determine his personal details. It felt stifling, like being trapped in a fog.

Above all, it was far too swift and deadly to be the work of just one human. It seemed impossible even with an insider’s help.

The vault keeper, feeling an uneasy premonition, sniffed the air.

“Release ‘Eomni’. Pick the ones with the best noses and tell them to catch that guy.”

“Yes. I’ll relay that. Then, the funds…”

The vault keeper decided to open the vault to eliminate him. Sherlock pulled out the key, inserted it into the safe lock, and firmly instructed.

“I can’t give you much. I’ll consider adding more depending on how the job progresses. Pass that along…”

Click. Just as he felt resistance and turned the key to pull it out.

The safe collapsed with a crash.

When you’re too flustered, your body freezes. The safe door slid limply toward him, frozen stiff. The steel safe that had always reliably protected Piki’s money now carelessly revealed its interior.

Spilling out onto the floor with the safe door were hundreds of cards. As if the safe had been transformed into nothing but a single sheet of leather, the entire structure collapsed in a heap once its support vanished.

The vault keeper’s panicked eyes darted inside. Instead of gold coins filling the vault, a mountain of pork piled high.

And atop the pork hill, a single card… grinning, mockingly welcoming the pig-man.

Voices began to drift into Ende. The frightened whispers of the pig-men overlapped, gradually weaving a horror akin to a ghost story.

No one knew where he came from, how he knew, or how powerful he was. Not wielding raw strength, but using the unknown as his weapon, he tore through Ende. No one could find him. They could only repeat it blankly.

Yet, those who had experienced ‘it’ even once murmured as if by unspoken agreement.

The magician has appeared.
