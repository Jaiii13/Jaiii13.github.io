The Regressor is moody. I knew that all along, but I've never felt it as keenly as I do these days.
“Hey? Where are you going today?”
“Need anything? Something you want to eat or something?”
“Or maybe your main weapon? I could get you a decent one!”
Because unlike the past when we were always bickering, things were going well lately, and feeling good made him want to keep giving me things. You only truly appreciate warmth after feeling the cold. The returner's kindness felt strangely unfamiliar.
But who am I? I'm a mind reader. I graciously accept kindness without reason. If not now, when would I get anything?
I answered the Returner's question about what he should buy me with confidence.
“Buy me some toys.”
“What?”
Wait, why? You asked if I needed anything. Why are you frowning at me like that?
While tracking Orkma, I revealed my face and movements completely. That was a decision made possible by the need to instill fear quickly and the fact I wouldn't be staying in this city long.
But because of that, I found myself in a position where I couldn't show my face. If Piggy spotted me, the mansion would become a target.
So when I explained I needed a toy to pass the time since I had to stay alone in the mansion, the Regressor replied with a sour expression.
“You're not just making excuses to avoid going out, are you?”
“What are you talking about? If I wasn't going out, I wouldn't have gone out at all. You doubt me even though I went out every night to beat up petty criminals? It hurts to have my sincerity questioned even after all that.”
“Ah, no. I was just asking.”
An excuse?! I only went out to work because I didn't want to listen to nagging! The best way to avoid nagging is to give them what they want!
“So what do you need?”
“Long cloth, rope, a disc, and a scratcher.”
“A scratcher?”
“It's like that cork thing prisoners use to file their nails and claws.”
“I know what that is. But why?”
I casually mentioned fighting the Wolf King, and honestly, my role in that fight would be utterly insignificant.
But that doesn't mean I can prepare half-heartedly. My mind-reading works only on humans. I can't read how the Wolf King will move, or where his fangs will strike. The fear of wolves is something even the human king cannot escape.
But there was one reason I stepped forward confidently even then. I raised my hand toward Aji.
“I think it's about time we started practicing our coordination.”
“Woof!”
Aji leapt up and clapped his paws in mine. He used no force, didn't show his claws, careful not to hurt me. His instinct to avoid harming humans had kicked in.
But when fighting wolves, there'll be no such luxury.
“Oh. So you're finally strategizing how to fight the wolf king?”
“It's not a strategy. Even if Ende and the wolf pack were fighting, do you think I could come up with a strategy, or that they'd follow it? Even if they did, the enemy is a mixed pack of wolves and humans—there's no way things would go according to plan. I don't waste my energy on things that won't work. I focus on what's more important.”
“What's more important?”
“My survival.”
I reached out my hand to Aji again. Aji instinctively stretched out his hand and placed it in mine. This is the level of force Aji usually exerts on me. In emergencies, it's rougher, but still not enough to hurt me.
But when fighting the Wolf King, he must know how to hurt me. That's the only way I won't die.
“Hand.”
“Woof!”
“Foot.”
“Woof!”
When I lift my hand, he leaps up to touch it. When I lift my foot, he lifts his own to touch mine. Right now, he treats me like a fragile tool... But he needs to learn my limits through this power struggle. Only then can he survive the battles ahead.
“Ah. I see. Can I watch too?”
“Not busy today?”
“Nope. Supplies are restocked, and there's nothing much to do until Groll enters Ende. Everything's going smoothly!”
“Hmph. Why does it feel so unsettling when Mr. Shay says things are going smoothly?”
“Why? Things going according to plan is perfectly normal, right?”
“Well, that depends on the person, apparently.”
‘What does that mean? Usually, things go according to plan every time I loop back… Does that mean I’m the one who messes things up? That’s because I did something I didn’t do in the previous loop. That kinda sucks.’
I tried to decipher the veiled insult. Just as the looping person was about to feel that vague unease, I interjected.
“Yes. Look. Actually, since we're on the topic, why don't you train in handling Aji too, Mr. Shay?”
“Training in handling Aji?”
‘Come to think of it, this is the first time I've seen an Aji emerge unscathed from the Abyss and actually fight. Until now, they've either vanished without a trace from the Abyss or been exploited by the Lord of All Creatures. Testing the Aji's power here might be worthwhile.’
“Alright.”
“Then go out and buy me the toy I mentioned.”
“Alright.”
The Returner readily stepped outside the mansion to run my errand. Stepping out into the fresh air, the Returner suddenly tilted their head, staring at the tightly shut mansion door.
‘Huh. But why am I running errands? I kinda feel like I've been tricked.’
Well, people can get talked into things sometimes. Just do it.
‘Ah well. Hughes worked hard too. I’ll just treat it like a stroll. Where can I buy it again? Gold coins should work, right?’
A moody person is a moody person. The Regressor, feeling unusually generous, cheerfully set off.
If I really go all out and rip them off today, I'll have enough for the whole year's business. Reading the recursor's fading thoughts, I offered congratulations to the End merchants.
Now then, what to do. Just as I was pondering what would happen next, Aji came over and started barking.
“Woof. Woof woof woof.”
“If you have something to say, speak human words. I can't understand if you don't.”
For someone like me who can't read dog minds, he's even learned to speak human language now. Aji spoke, a hint of worry visible beneath his innocent face.
“Not sleeping? Where are you going?”
“When? At night?”
“Woof.”
“To work.”
Usually, it's about beating up violent pig-men. Rumors are already spreading around Endee that the Dog King has appeared. Aji, who couldn't attack humans anyway, wouldn't have been much help even if I'd brought him along.
Explaining all that would've been bothersome and pointless, so I just gave a vague answer. Aji guessed roughly and said.
“Fight? With humans?”
People call stupid humans beast-like. It's not wrong. Beasts generally have lower intelligence than humans.
But intelligence itself is a measure set by humans. What if beasts were given human language? What would humans think while conversing with beasts?
For reference, I wouldn't think anything. I'm just another beast.
Seeing Aji had figured me out, I replied without much emotion.
“Usually, yeah. If it's not humans, there's no one else to fight.”
“Woof woof. Wolves!”
"The wolf king hasn't arrived yet. And I heard humans are helping the wolf king too. They call it a dog-wolf war, but it's really a proxy battle between two factions.“
”Woof...“
Aji suddenly looked dejected, ears and tail drooping, and asked.
”Human, why fight?“
”Why the sudden philosophical question? What's up? Beasts fighting each other is no big deal.“
”Woof! I won't fight humans!"
“You should fight. How long do you plan to avoid it?”
Among dogs, there are those who attack humans, and among wolves, there are those who bring humans into their pack and befriend them. That's probably because dogs and wolves share the same roots.
But Aji doesn't attack humans, while the wolf king charges madly at humans the moment he sees them. Considering this, the gap between beasts and the king of beasts feels strangely pronounced. Well, the king of beasts represents the collective will of its species, so it's not entirely incomprehensible.
“I won't fight! If I don't fight, I won't fight!”
“Is that really so? Beasts forget even the dinner they ate yesterday. They could forget everything and fight again.”
“Still, we won't fight! Woof! Forget about fighting!”
Right. If that's how you see it, then so be it. Human fights will still go on, but if we don't fight amidst them, then at least in our territory, there's no fighting.
“You will fight the wolf king, right?”
“Woof! Promise!”
“That promise is for you, not for me.”
“Woof?”
“Why the question mark when it's your own fight? Well, anyway, since we have the same enemy. Protect me, okay?”
“Woof!”
Guess you're not scared. Then again, I don't feel particularly scared either. Because it's inevitable. I've lost all my power and become ordinary, but the ‘promise’ I made as the Beast King still remains, driving me forward.
Guess I really am the Beast King. Not that it helps a bit, though.
“Still, it's better to prepare ahead of time and raise our chances of winning, even just a little.”
“Woof woof! Okay!”
Z2dKbDJFSCtSbEo3WFlpUEN0eDQxUmpOTlNFakpPekVCUytMVnhKaE5JbXNOTHpacmNTSHZJLzRVQlp4c09TUA
“But I still don't quite get it, Ajiya. How can we increase our chances of winning even more?”
“Woof. Woof?”
“Yeah. I don't know either. We're not prophets.”
Some prophet probably knows. But prophets can't choose the future for us. They just use the future they've read for their own gain.
I don't ask them to choose for me either. If one came near and offered to read my mind, I'd use it, but otherwise, no need.
“Then I think doing our best each time is the best approach, Ajiya. Understand?”
“...Woof woof. Bad face.”
“Me? Where would you find someone with a face as kind as mine?”
Ajiya crept away slowly and lay down a little distance off. Honestly, she reads human emotions better than most people. She's too dumb to be fooled by words or situations. She just senses it with her animal instincts, damn it.
But that didn't last long either.
“I bought it!”
The moment the returnee finished their errand and pulled out the toy, she immediately wagged her tail, showing interest. Seeing her like this definitely makes her look dumb.
